### Packages
I used  a spyder anaconda 2.7. The libraries used for this project are:

The packages that we used for this project are:
numpy
pandas
scipy
matplotlib
math
mpl_toolkits.basemap 
matplotlib.animation

### Purpose of this project

 The main goal of our research is to try to answer a difﬁcult question, what is the physical mechanism behind the 
 Northern Annular Mode? What factors are behind this index? A signiﬁcant variable that will help us 
 to interpret this index is the meridional mass ﬂux in isentropic coordinates and the cross isentropic mass ﬂux. 
 The initial stimulation of this research is that NAM index is related with the meridional isentropic massﬂux,
 which,in turn,may be related to the zonal mean location of cross isentropic mass ﬂux. 
 Our analysis leads us to observe a correlation of the meridional mass ﬂux with the NAM index.

2) MassfluxztmJ: Visualization of the zonal mean, time mean of meridional mass flux in Junuary

3)PV-analysis: Estimation of potential vorticity  in different layers in January

4)PCA-6 components: PCA analysis of our meteorological variables

5)massflux_zonalindexJ: Analysis and visualization of meridional mass flux and NAM index

6)massflux-namindex-January-Atlanti: Analysis and visualization of meridional mass flux and nam index  in January in the region of Atlantic ocean

 ### Results
 
   Our analysis leads us to observe a correlation of the meridional mass ﬂux with the NAM index. The eddy meridional 
mass ﬂux was found to be responsible for this correlation. Finally we observe that the eddy Potential Vorticity 
Substance(PVS) ﬂux determines  the behavior of the mean meridional mass ﬂux and as a result the relation of the total meridional 
mass ﬂux with the NAM index.
